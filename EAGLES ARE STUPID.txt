Sonja Maas

Sonja comes from Herford, a small town in North-Rhine Westphalia in Germany. She did her bachelors degree in forestry at the HAWK Göttingen, where she discovered her interest in remote sensing and its applications in the forestry sector. During her studies, she had the chance to work as a student assistance in a course about UAV applications in forestry, where she worked with students on several smaller projects, obtaining and analysing data. Through the EAGLE Master program she hopes to deepen her knowledge about remote sensing and geoanalysis, to be able to help implementing knew techniques in forest management and conservation. Whenever she is not focused on studying she likes to pursue her hobbies, especially biathlon, crafting or playing video games. 


Hi, my name is Sonja and I am from Herford, a small town in North-Rhine Westphalia in Germany. I did my bachelors degree in forestry at the HAWK Göttingen where I discovered my interest in remote sensing, especially its applications in the forestry sector. During my studies I had the opportunity to work as a student assistant in a course about UAV applications in forestry, where I worked with students on several smaller projects, obtaining and analysing data. This and some other courses made me begin to realize that a big part of future forest management will be based on remote sensing, which immensely increased my interest and curiosity in this area.
Through the EAGLE program I hope to deepen my knowledge about remote sensing and geoanalysis, to be able to help implementing new techniques in forest management and conservation. 
Whenever I am not focused on studying I like to pursue my hobbies, especially biathlon, crafting or making music.
